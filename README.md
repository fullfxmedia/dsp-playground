# DSP Playground

Various DSP experiments

- [pitchshift](pitchshift.ipynb): Pitch shift/time shift algorithms such as OLA, WSOLA, etc.
- [distortion](distortion.ipynb): Simple distortion with envelope follower utilizing hyperbolic tangent.

Special thanks to [JentGent](https://github.com/JentGent/pitch-shift) for the original OLA algorithm and idea.
